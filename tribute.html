        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Tim Bergling; 8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), known professionally as Avicii, was a Swedish DJ, remixer
            and music producer. At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which
            led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio
            album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally
            positive reviews. It peaked in the top 10 in more than 15 countries and topped international charts; the
            lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01). His
            catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey
            Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and "Lonely
            Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012
            and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic
            music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s.</p>
        <p>
            Bergling retired from touring in 2016, after several years of stress and poor mental health. On 20 April
            2018, he committed suicide while on holiday in Muscat, Oman. In 2019, his third and final album, Tim, was
            released posthumously.</p>

            Chainsmokers' Drew Taggart said, "His passing was a great loss for the music world and for us. He was an
            artist who inspired so many in so many ways, and simply put, he meant so much to us and everyone in the EDM
            community." Halsey then delivered an emotional discussion about mental health and emphasized the need for
            people to love and support each other.</p>

            late DJ, describing him as "a really good friend" who "changed [her] life". A similar tribute was also paid
            by Ora during King's Day and Capital's Summertime Ball.</p>
        <p>
            The 2018 edition of Tomorrowland saw several tributes to Bergling from Axwell Λ Ingrosso, Don Diablo, Nicky
            Romero, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Zedd and Kygo, the latter mentioning that Bergling was his biggest
            influence in EDM. All DJs honoured his memory by playing his music in their sets during the festival which
            Michael Thivaios (Like Mike) described as Bergling's home. Thivaios continued calling Bergling "one of [his]
            best friends" and "a great inspiration". Avicii's songs "Levels" and "Wake Me Up" came second and eighth
            respectively in Tomorrowland 2018's most played songs.</p>
        <p>
            On 27 July, Russian DJ and producer Arty released a song called "Tim" as a tribute to Bergling. "I made a
            track for my friend", he stated. "I just want to honor his memory. I want to do something right, and in my
            opinion it's the right thing to do."</p>
        <p>
            During the 2018 version of Creamfields, Kaleidoscope Orchestra performed a special tribute performance,
            where they played out Bergling's greatest dance hits.</p>
        <p>
            On 12 October, Vicetone released a song called "South Beach", which they stated was influenced by Bergling's
            music and was one of the first songs they created, and that they decided to finish and release it as a
            tribute.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to the live tributes, many other artists including Eric Prydz, Imagine Dragons, Skrillex, Calvin
            Harris, Hardwell, Deadmau5, Marshmello, Zedd and Robbie Williams also paid tribute to Bergling on Twitter.
